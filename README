mlcollection is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented
in python.  The library seeks to provide a few main goals listed here.
These goals may change over time as the community gains interest and
seeks to move the project in another direction.  For now, the goal is
as follows:

1. To gain further knowledge of machine learning algorithms, have some
   fun, do some research, and gain greater familiarity with the algorithms,
   ideas, and concepts surrounding the machine learning world.

2. To provide a well-designed and easy-to-use python library that others
   can use in their research and work.

3. To help others learn the same machine learning algorithms through
   well written source and ample documentation (sphinx docs).
